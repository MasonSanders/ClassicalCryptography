Basic structure of the html file:
there are two top level divs, DecryptDiv and EncryptDiv
those divide the cipher types into their own divs
an element with a D in its id means that it's for Decryption
an element  with E in its id means thata it's for Encryption
for example: ShiftCipherDivE is for encryption
ShiftDPlainOut is for Decryption
The naming convention for the Id's of all my elements begin with a capital letter with camel case.
the naming convention in my javascript methods and variables begin with lowercase followed by camel case.
